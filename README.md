# Determination-of-Trace-Organic-Contaminant-Concentration-via-Machine-Classification-of-Raman-Spectra
Codebase and Data for "Determination-of-Trace-Organic-Contaminant-Concentration-via-Machine-Classification-of-Raman-Spectra."

Code files are given as Jupyter notebooks. Raw spectral data is availible as .csv files in all main folders under subfolder "RAMAN Data MITACs". Generated figures and raw data tables are availible in folder "Tables and Figures". Permission for usage of figures or diagrams is allowable with notification and citation. All files named "~Iterable.ipynb" in the folder "CNN Models" are CNN cross validation notebooks and are made to run on Niagara supercomputer(80 core), this may result in unintended phenomena if run on standard computers. "Key Functions.ipynb" contains all user defined functions for the codebase, a .py copy of this file is needed in all major folders. File paths used in "Key Functions.ipynb" may vary when downloaded, if this is the case please make the appropriate changes and update all the folders with "Key Functions.py".
